General Explanation:

Overview:
This program demonstrates a particle system interacting with harmonic colors based on user input. The particles exhibit various behaviors influenced by the mouse position and color settings.

User Interaction:

    Mouse Dragging: Click and drag the mouse to add particles to the system.
    Key '1': Particles exhibit behavior based on harmonic color interactions.
    Key '2': Particles respond differently, introducing an alternate color interaction.

GUI Controls:

    Trail Slider: Adjust the trail length behind particles.
    Point Slider: Control the number of particles added with each mouse drag.
    Dot Size Slider: Set the size of the particles.
    Red, Green, Blue Sliders: Adjust the RGB values to explore different color interactions.

Additional Features:

    Toggle Lines ('l' key): Switch between drawing lines connecting particles.

Exploration:

    Experiment with color settings to observe harmonic interactions.
    Observe particle behavior with different key inputs.
    Adjust GUI sliders to customize the visual experience.

Note: This is a one-time explanation. Feel free to explore and experiment with the project!
