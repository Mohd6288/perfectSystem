# Particle Harmony Interaction

## Overview
This program, built using openFrameworks, demonstrates a dynamic particle system that interacts with harmonic colors based on user inputs. The particles exhibit a range of behaviors influenced by mouse positioning and color settings, offering an interactive and visually engaging experience.

## User Interaction
- **Mouse Dragging**: Click and drag the mouse across the screen to introduce new particles into the system.
- **Key '1'**: Activates particle behavior based on harmonic color interactions.
- **Key '2'**: Triggers an alternative color interaction mode for the particles.

## GUI Controls
- **Trail Slider**: Adjusts the length of the trail behind each particle.
- **Point Slider**: Controls the number of particles that are added with each mouse drag.
- **Dot Size Slider**: Sets the overall size of the particles in the system.
- **RGB Sliders**: Allows the user to fine-tune the Red, Green, and Blue color values, enabling a deep exploration of color interactions.

## Additional Features
- **Toggle Lines ('l' key)**: Switches between drawing lines that connect particles, enhancing the visual complexity of the system.

## Exploration
Users are encouraged to:
- Experiment with various color settings to observe how harmonic interactions change.
- Observe the distinct particle behaviors when different keys are pressed.
- Use the GUI sliders to tailor the visual experience to their preference.

## Running the Code
To run the code, follow these steps:
1. Ensure you have openFrameworks installed.
2. Clone the repository or download the source code.
3. Open the project with an application that supports openFrameworks.
4. Include the necessary GUI addons.
5. Add existing files and assets located in the `bin` folder of the project directory.
6. Compile and run the project.

## Note
This project is designed for exploration and experimentation. Feel free to interact with the system and observe the various effects your inputs have on the particle dynamics and color interactions!
